            <b><h1>WHAT IS DIGITAL LITERACY?</h1></b>
            <p>The knowledge and understanding of the use of technology.</p>
       
            <div class="intro"><p>Digital Literacy is the knowledge, skills and behaviours used in a network of digital devices. Literacy focuses on the broad terms and skills of numeracy, listening, speaking, reading and writing, and critical thinking with the end goal to be able to develop active thinkers and learners into meaningful contributors to an effective society. With the aid of digital literacy, society is now able to broaden their knowledge at a faster pace than ever before, as well as include a wide variety of ethical, social and reflective practices imbedded within the work, learning, leisure and daily life. Digital Literacy can often be seen through three efficient parts: use, understand and create.

                <P>Use</P>
            </div>
            <div id="panelUse">
                <p><b>Use</b> represents the technical fluency needed to engage on the world-wide-web and such technological devices. Knowing of how to use a computer and its given programs/applications such as word-processor, web-browsers, games, emails…are all skills that fall under the use of digital literacy. Any form of accessing and using knowledge resources such as search-engines and/or online databases, or even more so sophisticated activities such as the use of emerging technologies as cloud-computing are all the usage of digital literacy. Almost any and all procedures from opening to closing your digital-device are a significant part of digital literacy.</p>

                <P>Understand</P>
            </div>
            <div id="panelUnderstand">
                <p>To <b>understand</b> is also a critical part of digital literacy, in helping the user to comprehend, contextualize and critically evaluate digital media. All such uses then further assist the user to understand such content and proceed to make more informed and well-practices decisions from what they encounter online. Understanding includes the recognition of network technology and its effect on our behaviour, perceptions, beliefs, teachings, morals, and even feelings on about the world around us. On a more practical and significant matter, understanding digital literacy is to learn and develop – individually and collectively – information management skills for finding and effectively evaluating by the use of information to communicate, collaborate and solve problems.</p>

            <div id="panelCreate">
                <p>To <b>create</b> is the ability to produce content and communicate through a variety of digital media tools. More than just using a web-search or writing an email, creation with digital media is the inclusion to be able to know on how to adapt production elements for various contents and audiences. To be able to effectively communicate through text, audio and visual and engage another user in various forms of created digital media. Creating is to be able to produce and share any form of social media such as blogs, forums, photo/video sharing, and social gaming….or even educating others. </p>
